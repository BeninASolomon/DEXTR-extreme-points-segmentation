# DEXTR Extreme Points Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of **DEXTR (Deep Extreme Cut)**, a model designed for image segmentation using extreme points as guidance. The model combines a U-Net-like architecture with a custom `ExtremePointsLayer` to process extreme points for efficient segmentation.

## Features
- **Extreme Points Integration**: This model takes in extreme points as input along with the image to enhance segmentation accuracy.
- **U-Net-like Architecture**: Utilizes an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections for effective feature extraction and image reconstruction.
- **Custom Layer**: A custom `ExtremePointsLayer` to tile and reshape extreme points into the networkâ€™s feature maps.
- **Supports Grayscale Images**: Model works with 100x100 grayscale images, but can be adjusted for different sizes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
